  ======================================================================

  DATA DRIVEN TESTING:

  - Execute the same test with multiple sets of test data.

  •Assume, you need to test login form with 50 different sets of test data
  •As a manual tester, you do log in with all the 50 different sets of test data for 50 times
  •As an automation tester, you create a test script and run 50 times by changing the test data on each run or you create 50 test scripts to execute the scenario
  •We can achieve Data-driven framework using:
    - TestNG's data provider
    - Cucumber scenario outlines
    - Excel apache poi
